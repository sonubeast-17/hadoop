# Flappy Game - Custom Version

A Flappy Bird-style game with custom images and audio support.

## How to Customize

### 1. Replace Images
- **Bird Image**: Replace `bird.png` with your custom bird image
  - Recommended size: 40x40 pixels or larger (will be cropped to square)
  - Format: PNG, JPG, or GIF
  - The image will be displayed as a rounded square
- **Pipe Image**: Replace `pipe.png` with your custom pipe image
  - Any size works (will be stretched to fit pipe dimensions)
  - Format: PNG, JPG, or GIF
  - Used for both top and bottom pipes

### 2. Replace Audio
- **Jump Sound**: Replace `tap.mp3` with your custom jump sound
  - Format: MP3, WAV, or OGG
  - Keep it short (under 1 second recommended)
- **Game Over Sound**: Replace `lose.mp3` with your custom game over sound
  - Format: MP3, WAV, or OGG
  - Duration: 1-3 seconds recommended

### 3. How to Add Your Files
1. **For Images**: Simply copy your image files to the game folder and rename them:
   - Your bird image → `bird.png`
   - Your pipe image → `pipe.png`

2. **For Audio**: Copy your audio files and rename them:
   - Your jump sound → `tap.mp3`
   - Your game over sound → `lose.mp3`

3. **Refresh** the browser to see your custom assets

### 4. Image Recommendations
- **Bird**: Use a character, logo, or any image that looks good when cropped to a square
